# Installing-Updating-and-Removing-Software-in-Windows

This will teach you how to perform basic software maintenance on Windows machines. This includes installing software not already present on a machine, updating existing software, and uninstalling software that's no longer needed.

There will be 3 objectives:

  - <b>Install</b> the Mozilla Firefox web Browser.
  - <b>Update</b> an old version of VLC Media Player to the newest version.
  - <b>Uninstall</b> the GIMP editor from the machine, removing it entirely.

<h3>Verifying Software on Windows</h3>

To verify whether a program is installed or not open "Apps & Features" on your machine. This shows a list of every program installed on the computer.

Here if I scroll through the applet I can see that our machine won't have Firefox installed and that VLC and GIMP are.

<h3>Installing Mozilla Firefox</h3>

First, let's install Firefox. Open up your current web browser and navigate to this URL: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/ by clicking on the link or searching it in Google. From this site, click the <b>Download</b> link to download the installer.

When I download programs, I prefer opening the installer from the downloads folder in Windows Explorer which you can find at the bottom of your screen.

Launch the installer and start the installation process. Click Next through any options that appear or customize it to your liking. Wait for the process to finish, and Mozilla will be installed. A shortcut will be added to the desktop and you can now open your newly installed browser.

<h3>Updating VLC Media Player</h3>

You can see here that we have VLC Media Player running an older version.

First, we need to get an installer for the new version from VLC's website: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html 

By going to our System About settings we can see that we have a 64-bit system.

For this reason, we will download the 64-bit installer.

Launch the installer and go through the process as we did with Mozilla. Reopen the Apps & Features window and we can see that VLC is now the latest version.

<h3>Uninstalling GIMP</h3>

Uninstalling programs is very simple. Navigate to the Apps & Features window, click on the program you want to remove, and click Uninstall.

A confirmation menu will appear. Click Yes to begin the uninstallation process.

When the process finishes, a confirmation menu will appear again. This completes the uninstallation process!
